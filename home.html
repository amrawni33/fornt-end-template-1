            <h2>what we do</h2>
            <p>Most of us wonder if there is a God and if He really is the God of the Bible. In the Bible God says ‘I will make your
            name great’ and today the name of Abraham/Abram is known worldwide. This promise has come true. The earliest copy of
            Genesis found in the Dead Sea Scrolls is dated 200-100 B.C. which means the promise has been in writing since at least
            that time. At that time the name of Abraham was not well-known so the promise came true only after it was written down,
            not before.</p>
